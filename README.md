# List Whitelist
A Minecraft plugin that allows admins to easily whitelist multiple players from text files

## Usage
Run the server with the plugin installed once and a "whitelists/" folder will be created in your plugins folder.
Create a text file with a list of usernames you want to easily whitelist or un-whitelist.

After configuring a few lists, run the command ``/listwhitelist <add/remove> <filename>``. This will add or remove all the listed players from your server's whitelist.
